### Assignment 1

Task: Implement syscalls like getppid(), waitpid(), pinfo(), custom fork() and some user wrapper functions around syscalls like getpid(), pipe(), etc

Score: 97/100. \
Remark for deductions: Execution time computation is buggy. (-3)

### Assignment 2

Task: Had to implement 4 process scheduling algorithms: \
1. Non-preemptive FCFS
2. Non-preemptive SJF
3. Preemptive RR
4. Preemptive UNIX scheduler

Also had to compare these 4 algorithms using some statistics like Batch execution time, Average waiting time, Average turnaround time, Completion time, etc.

Score: 100/100

### Assignment 3

Task: Had to implement conditional variables and semaphores and use them to solve the Barrier problem and the Multiple Producers-Multiple Consumers Bounded Buffer Problem.

Score: 100/100
